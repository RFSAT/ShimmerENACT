# ShimmerENACT Changelog

RFSAT Limited — ENACT Project (Horizon Europe Grant 101157151)

## v2.1.4

### Fixed
- **Map resizes and overlaps graph on pan or selection change** — two root causes:

  1. *`MapView.requestLayout()` escaping into Compose* — osmdroid calls
     `requestLayout()` (not just `invalidate()`) every time it redraws: on tile
     load, pan, zoom, and overlay invalidation. This propagated through the Android
     view hierarchy into Compose's layout pass, causing the `AndroidView` to be
     remeasured. During remeasurement `MapView.onMeasure()` could return a size
     different from what Compose originally allocated, making the map grow or shrink
     and push the graph out of place. Fixed with two measures:
     - `height(320.dp)` replaced by `requiredHeight(320.dp)` — Compose's
       `requiredHeight` sets `MeasureSpec.EXACTLY` on the child and ignores the
       child's reported desired size, so whatever `MapView.onMeasure()` returns is
       discarded.
     - `MapView` wrapped in an anonymous subclass that overrides `onMeasure` to
       always call `setMeasuredDimension` with the spec's exact size — a belt-and-
       braces guard ensuring the size is locked even if Compose's modifier alone
       is insufficient.

  2. *Cursor readout row changing height on selection* — the value readout `Box`
     switched between a one-line placeholder and a one-line data row, but the two
     had different intrinsic heights due to icon/text padding differences. This
     caused the scrollable upper panel to change height, which re-triggered the
     outer Column's layout pass and shifted the map block. Fixed by giving the
     readout `Box` a fixed `height(36.dp)` so it is always the same size regardless
     of whether a point is selected.

## v2.1.3

### Fixed
- **Compile error: wrong `Overlay.draw()` signature** — `DotsOverlay` and
  `SelectionOverlay` overrode `draw(Canvas, Projection, Boolean)`, which does not
  exist as an abstract method in `org.osmdroid.views.overlay.Overlay`. The correct
  abstract method to override is `draw(Canvas, MapView, Boolean)`. Because the
  wrong signature was used, the compiler saw a new non-abstract method rather than
  an override, leaving the actual abstract `draw` unimplemented — making both
  classes effectively abstract and preventing instantiation. Fixed by changing the
  second parameter from `Projection` to `MapView` and obtaining the projection
  inside the body via `mapView.projection`. The now-unused
  `import org.osmdroid.views.Projection` is also removed.

## v2.1.2

### Fixed
- **Compile errors: `IGeoPoint` unresolved and `SimpleFastPointOverlay` generics** —
  The v2.1.1 fix attempted to use `mutableListOf<org.osmdroid.util.IGeoPoint>` and
  `ArrayList<org.osmdroid.util.IGeoPoint>` to satisfy `SimplePointTheme`'s constructor
  signature. This failed because `IGeoPoint` lives in `org.osmdroid.api`, not
  `org.osmdroid.util`, and because the Kotlin generic type argument was still not
  accepted by the Java API. Root fix: **`SimpleFastPointOverlay` and `SimplePointTheme`
  are removed entirely**. Cyan measurement dots and the red selection circle are now
  drawn by two small custom `Overlay` subclasses (`DotsOverlay`, `SelectionOverlay`)
  that paint directly onto the `Canvas` using `Projection.toPixels()` — no generics,
  no external API contracts to satisfy.
- **Compile error: `BoundingBox.fromGeoPoints` type mismatch** — `fromGeoPoints`
  takes `List<GeoPoint>`, not `List<IGeoPoint>`. The cast
  `geoPoints as List<IGeoPoint>` was incorrect and also used the wrong package.
  Fixed by computing the bounding box directly from the min/max of the `GeoPoint`
  latitude and longitude values and constructing
  `BoundingBox(north, east, south, west)` explicitly.

## v2.1.1

### Fixed
- **Compile error: `SimplePointTheme` type mismatch (lines 174, 521)** —
  `SimplePointTheme` constructor expects `MutableList<IGeoPoint>`, not
  `MutableList<GeoPoint>` or `ArrayList<GeoPoint>`. Kotlin does not automatically
  widen a concrete subtype list to the interface list expected by the Java API.
  Fixed by using `mutableListOf<IGeoPoint>(pt)` and `ArrayList<IGeoPoint>(geoPoints)`
  with the explicit interface type argument.
- **Compile error: `HorizontalDivider` unresolved reference (line 473)** —
  `HorizontalDivider` was introduced in Material3 1.2.0; the project uses
  `compose-bom:2023.10.01` which resolves to Material3 1.1.x. Replaced with the
  compatible `Divider` composable, which is available in all Material3 1.x versions.

## v2.1.0

### Changed
- **Map: replaced WebView + Leaflet.js with native osmdroid MapView** —
  The WebView approach was abandoned after four unsuccessful releases. The root cause
  is that `WebView.loadDataWithBaseURL()` does not grant the loaded page network access
  to third-party origins regardless of the base URL argument; Android's security model
  treats the page as coming from a synthetic context and blocks the Leaflet CDN fetch
  and OSM tile requests. There is no setting combination that reliably fixes this across
  Android API 26–35 without running a local HTTP server.

  The map is now rendered with **osmdroid 6.1.20** (`org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android`),
  a pure-Android native library that draws OpenStreetMap tiles directly on a `MapView`
  canvas using standard Android `HttpURLConnection` networking — no WebView, no
  JavaScript engine, no CDN, no CORS:
  - Tile source: OSM Standard (MAPNIK) — same data as Leaflet was using
  - `MapView` integrates with Jetpack Compose via `AndroidView`, identical to the
    existing `LineChart` integration
  - Cyan polyline connecting all measurement GPS positions (`Polyline` overlay)
  - Solid cyan dot at every individual measurement position (`SimpleFastPointOverlay`)
  - Red filled circle (22 px) marks the currently selected sample; updated via
    `LaunchedEffect(selectedIndex)` replacing and re-adding a `SimpleFastPointOverlay`
  - Map pans to the selected point with `controller.animateTo()`
  - On first display, the view is fitted to the bounding box of all GPS points via
    `zoomToBoundingBox()` called in a `post {}` block after layout
  - `Configuration.userAgentValue` set to identify the app to OSM tile servers per
    OSM tile usage policy
  - `INTERNET` permission already declared in `AndroidManifest.xml` from v2.0.0

### Added
- `org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.20` dependency in `app/build.gradle`
  (Apache 2.0 licence; available on Maven Central; no additional repository required)

## v2.0.3

### Fixed
- **Graph: independent X/Y zoom** — `setPinchZoom(true)` caused both axes to zoom
  identically together. Changed to `setPinchZoom(false)`: with both `isScaleXEnabled`
  and `isScaleYEnabled` true, MPAndroidChart detects the dominant direction of a
  two-finger gesture and zooms only that axis — a predominantly horizontal spread
  zooms the time axis, a predominantly vertical spread zooms the value axis.
- **Map: WebView now renders correctly** — root cause identified and fixed. The
  entire screen was wrapped in `verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())`. Compose
  scroll containers measure their children with *unbounded (infinite) height*; the
  Android view system then assigns the `WebView` zero actual pixels and it renders
  nothing — the label "LOCATION TRACE" appeared but the map area was blank.
  Fix: the layout is restructured into a non-scrollable outer `Column`. The upper
  section (stats strip, value readout, chart) is wrapped in its own `verticalScroll`
  column sized with `weight(1f)`. The map `AndroidView` sits below it as a separate
  sibling with an explicit `height(320.dp)` — fully constrained, outside any
  scroll container, so the WebView receives its correct measured dimensions and
  Leaflet renders the map. The `osmHtml` string is now built in `remember(gpsPoints)`
  (computed before composition) and loaded directly in `factory`, eliminating the
  previous `update`-lambda timing complexity.

## v2.0.2

### Fixed
- **Map: OSM tiles and Leaflet now render correctly** — two independent bugs caused
  the location trace panel to remain blank:
  1. *SRI integrity check failure* — `<link>` and `<script>` tags for Leaflet (loaded
     from `unpkg.com`) carried `integrity=` SHA-256 hashes and `crossorigin=""`.
     When `loadDataWithBaseURL` is used inside an Android `WebView`, the page is
     served from a synthetic internal origin; the CORS preflight for the CDN resource
     fails, the integrity check cannot be completed, and the browser silently refuses
     to execute the script. Leaflet never initialised, leaving a blank `<div>`. Fix:
     `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes removed from both tags.
  2. *Stale HTML captured in `factory` lambda* — `AndroidView.factory` is called
     exactly once when the view enters the composition. The GPS data is loaded
     asynchronously, so `gpsPoints` is empty when `factory` first runs; the HTML
     computed at that moment contained no coordinates. By the time data arrived,
     `factory` was never called again. Fix: HTML is now built in
     `LaunchedEffect(gpsPoints)` and stored in a `MutableState<String>`
     (`osmHtmlState`). The `update` lambda — which runs on every recompose — reads
     the current value and calls `loadDataWithBaseURL` whenever the content changes
     (guarded by a `tag`-based hash to prevent redundant reloads).
- **Map: cyan measurement dots now fully filled** — `fillOpacity` raised from `0.7`
  to `1.0` so every dot is solid cyan with no transparency.

## v2.0.1

### Fixed
- **Graph: zoom preserved across interactions** — `fitScreen()` was being called inside
  the Compose `update` lambda, which runs on every recomposition (including on every
  `selectedIndex` state change). This reset the viewport on every tap, making zoom
  impossible to hold. Data is now pushed to the chart exclusively via
  `LaunchedEffect(entries)`, which only fires when the underlying dataset changes.
  `fitScreen()` is called once at that point; subsequent taps and drags no longer
  touch the viewport. Pinch-to-zoom (`setPinchZoom(true)`) re-enabled.
- **Graph: selected-point circle enlarged** — red fill radius increased from 12 px
  to 18 px; white ring radius increased from 14 px to 22 px with a 3 px stroke width,
  making the indicator clearly visible on small-screen devices.
- **Map: OSM tiles and Leaflet now load correctly** — `loadDataWithBaseURL` was using
  `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/` as the base URL, but Leaflet is loaded from
  `unpkg.com`; the mismatched origin caused the WebView security context to block the
  CDN scripts. Base URL changed to `https://www.openstreetmap.org/` (same registrable
  domain as the tile server), which satisfies the browser security model and allows
  Leaflet to bootstrap. `mixedContentMode` set to `MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW` and
  `useWideViewPort` / `loadWithOverviewMode` enabled. Background colour set to the
  app dark colour instead of transparent to prevent the white-flash before tiles load.
- **CI: debug APK build removed** — the workflow now builds and publishes only the
  release APK and release AAB. `lintRelease` and `testReleaseUnitTest` replace their
  debug-variant equivalents. Artifact names updated to
  `ShimmerENACT-<version>-release` and `ShimmerENACT-<version>-PlayStore`.



### Added
- **Graph: data-point circles** — every measurement is now marked with a small filled
  circle in the same colour as the signal line, giving a clear visual indication of
  sample density and individual sample positions. Circles are drawn for datasets up to
  5 000 points; above that threshold they are suppressed to prevent a solid-band effect
  at very high sample rates.
- **Graph: red selected-point indicator** — the previously used vertical + horizontal
  crosshair lines are replaced by a prominent red filled circle (white border) drawn
  exactly on the selected measurement. Selection is updated continuously during tap and
  drag, giving real-time tracing without visual clutter.
- **Location trace map** — when a recording CSV contains GPS columns
  (`latitude_deg`, `longitude_deg`) a scrollable OpenStreetMap panel is shown beneath
  the signal graph. The map displays:
  - A cyan polyline connecting all measurement positions in chronological order
  - A small cyan dot at every individual measurement position
  - A red circle (white border) that moves to the GPS position of the currently selected
    measurement as the user taps or drags on the graph; the map pans smoothly to follow
- **OpenStreetMap integration (Leaflet.js)** — the location map is rendered inside an
  in-process `WebView` using [Leaflet.js 1.9.4](https://leafletjs.com/) loaded via CDN.
  OSM standard raster tiles (`tile.openstreetmap.org`) are used. No API key is required.
  The `INTERNET` permission is declared in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **Versioning scheme** — version numbering migrated to
  `<major>.<minor>.<revision>` semantics:
  - **major** — incremented for breaking or architectural changes
  - **minor** — incremented for significant new features
  - **revision** — incremented for bug fixes and corrections only
  - This release is v2.0.0 as the first version under the new scheme

### Changed
- `RecordingViewerScreen`: screen is now vertically scrollable so the map panel can
  sit below the chart without clipping on small-screen devices
- CSV parser extended to detect and read `latitude_deg` and `longitude_deg` columns
  (written by the v1.8.0+ `LocationRepository`); values are stored in `CsvPoint` and
  passed to the map renderer
- `versionCode` bumped to 53; `versionName` set to `"2.0.0"`



### Added
- **GPS location tagging in recordings**: every CSV row now includes four additional
  columns — `latitude_deg`, `longitude_deg`, `altitude_m`, `location_accuracy_m` —
  populated from the Android Fused Location Provider at 1 Hz (fastest 4 Hz) with
  `PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY`
  - Columns are present in the header of all new recordings; cells are empty (`,,,,`)
    for any row where no GPS fix is available (permission denied or fix not yet acquired)
  - `LocationRepository` seeds itself from the last known position immediately on
    `startUpdates()` so the very first data row typically has coordinates
  - Location updates start when recording begins and stop when it ends, conserving
    battery between sessions
- **New file**: `data/repository/LocationRepository.kt` — thin wrapper around
  `FusedLocationProviderClient`; exposes `StateFlow<Location?>` for use across the app

### Changed
- `play-services-location:21.3.0` added as a dependency
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` manifest declaration: `maxSdkVersion="30"` cap removed so
  GPS permission is available on all API levels (was silently missing on API 31+)
- `ConnectScreen`: `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` added to the API 31+ permission request
  list alongside `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` and `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`; permission banner text
  updated to mention location tagging

## v1.7.6

### Changed
- `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` raised to **35** (Android 15) — required by
  Google Play Store for new app submissions; `buildToolsVersion` updated to
  `35.0.0` accordingly

### Fixed
- Recordings screen: storage permission is now requested at runtime before the
  session list is loaded
  - On API 26–32: `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` runtime permission is requested via the
    standard system dialog; sessions from previous installs become readable once
    the permission is granted
  - On API 33+: `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is no longer effective for non-media files
    in `Downloads`; the screen detects this and offers a button that opens the
    system **All files access** settings page for the app
  - `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` declaration in `AndroidManifest.xml` extended to all
    API levels (previously capped at `maxSdkVersion="32"`) and
    `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` added (with `tools:ignore="ScopedStorage"`) to
    support the API 30+ all-files-access grant
  - Session list refreshes automatically once the permission is granted (driven by
    `LaunchedEffect(hasStorageAccess)`)

## v1.7.5

### Fixed
- Google Play upload: `applicationId` changed to `com.ShimmerENACT` to match the
  package name registered in Google Play Console; the Kotlin source `namespace`
  (`com.rfsat.shimmerenact`) is unchanged — no source file edits required
- Recordings list: files from sessions recorded with earlier app versions now
  appear correctly with their size and row count; root cause was that
  `f.bufferedReader(Charsets.UTF_8)` throws `MalformedInputException` when the
  file contains bytes that are invalid UTF-8 (written by older `FileWriter` calls
  that defaulted to the device locale charset on some devices); replaced with
  `InputStreamReader` backed by a `CharsetDecoder` configured with
  `CodingErrorAction.REPLACE` so bad bytes are silently substituted rather
  than causing the whole file parse to fail and return `null`

## v1.7.4

### Fixed
- `RecordingRepository.parseRecordingFile`: compile error — `return null` inside
  expression-body function (`= try { … }`); converted to block body (`{ … }`) with
  `return null` guard and `return try { … } catch { … }`

## v1.7.3

### Fixed
- Graph viewer: selected sample now marked with a filled contrast dot (dark fill,
  green border) at the highlight position; dragging a pressed finger across the
  chart continuously updates both the dot and the value readout row — achieved via
  `OnChartGestureListener.onChartTranslate` calling `getHighlightByTouchPoint`
- Graph viewer: CSV now read with `useLines(Charsets.UTF_8)` — explicit charset
  prevents `MalformedInputException` on files written by older app versions on
  devices whose default locale charset was not UTF-8
- Recordings: `parseRecordingFile` rewritten as a streaming line reader — no longer
  loads the entire file into memory with `readLines()`; reads only header metadata
  and counts rows on the fly; reports `sizeBytes` and `rowCount` correctly for all
  session files including those from earlier app versions
- Sensors tab: tapping "Sensors" in the bottom nav now always navigates to the
  Home screen, including when connected and viewing the Live/Dashboard screen;
  the previous `saveState`/`restoreState` combination was restoring the Dashboard
  back-stack entry instead of showing Home
- README.md: version references updated to v1.7.3; `RecordingViewerScreen` added
  to architecture diagram

## v1.7.2

### Fixed
- `RecordingViewerScreen`: type mismatch compile error on line 92 — `if/else`
  returning `Long?` assigned to `Long`; flattened into a single nullable chain
  terminated by `?: continue`

## v1.7.1

### Fixed
- Recordings list: sessions now refresh every time the Files tab is opened, so
  sessions recorded in the current app launch appear without restarting the app
- Recordings list: `listSessions()` no longer silently drops sessions when any
  individual file fails to parse; each failure is logged and the rest of the session
  is still shown; permission errors are logged explicitly
- Graph viewer: chart now scales the time axis to fit all data on first display
  (`fitScreen()` + `notifyDataSetChanged()` called after setting data); previously
  MPAndroidChart rendered at its default zoom, compressing all points into one line
- Graph viewer: CSV column detection rewritten — finds `timestamp_ms` and value
  columns by name rather than assuming fixed positions; handles footer comment lines
  (e.g. `# Session end:`) without treating them as data rows
- Graph viewer: chart entries are built once per data load inside `remember(points)`
  rather than on every recomposition; prevents redundant LineDataSet rebuilds

## v1.7.0

### Fixed
- Graph viewer: tapping the chart icon on a file row now correctly opens the viewer
  (the `onView` callback was wired into `SessionCard` but not forwarded into `FileRow`)
- Recordings list: sessions recorded with earlier versions now appear correctly;
  session start time is extracted from the rightmost 19 characters of the directory
  name (`yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss`) instead of a broken substring reconstruction that
  failed for device names containing underscores

## v1.6.0

### Added
- About screen now reads version from BuildConfig — version number is always consistent
  with the build, no longer needs manual update
- Graph viewer for recorded CSV files — tap the chart icon on any file in Recordings
  to view its data as an interactive line chart with pinch-to-zoom and drag
- Value tracing in graph viewer — tap any point to display its exact timestamp and value
- Summary statistics (min / mean / max / sample count) shown above the graph
- Robust loading of sessions recorded with earlier app versions (v1.0, v1.1):
  bare CSV files in the ShimmerENACT root are grouped under a "Legacy recordings"
  session; header parsing handles all past formats with graceful fallbacks
- Older session deletion now works correctly for all directory naming schemes

### Changed
- Home screen shows a "Connected" status card when a sensor is already connected,
  replacing the "Connect to Shimmer3" button — prevents accidental re-connection
- Disconnect button on Home screen is disabled while recording is in progress
- Paired Bluetooth device list shows only Shimmer devices by default; a "Show all"
  toggle reveals other paired devices when needed
- Connect screen blocks further connection attempts when a sensor is already connected

## v1.1.1 (current)

### Fixed
- Correct Shimmer3 BT channel type codes (all codes from 0x07 onwards were wrong)
  — GSR is `0x15`, PPG/ExpA0 is `0x17`, Gyro is `0x0C–0x0E`, Mag is `0x09–0x0B`
- Inquiry response reading now waits for complete channel list (was truncating after
  first BT fragment, causing only Accel X/Y to be parsed)
- Added `SENSOR_MAG` to GSR+ default bitmap (Magnetometer was absent from fallback)
- Log screen: entries no longer scroll away — auto-scroll only fires when at bottom;
  manual scroll up is preserved; Jump-to-Bottom FAB added
- Log buffer increased from 500 to 1000 entries
- Removed per-packet verbose parser logs that flooded the log buffer at 250 Hz
- Deselected chart signals now clear immediately (chart.data = null on empty selection)
- LogScreen brace balance fix (compilation error)

## v1.1.0

### Added
- Diagnostic Log screen with colour-coded entries (DEBUG / INFO / OK / WARN / ERROR)
- Error count badge on Log tab icon
- Per-signal configurable sampling rates (hardware rate + software decimation)
- Independent recording signal selection (separate from Live view display selection)
- One CSV file per signal per recording session, with ISO 8601 timestamps
- Session-grouped recordings view with per-file share and delete
- Recording setup sheet showing output rate per signal before starting
- Supported-parameter enforcement — unavailable signals hidden after connection

### Fixed
- Channel-list-based packet parser replaces bitmap inference
- Correct Shimmer3 inquiry response bitmap offset (byte 4)
- ADXL345 accel data width corrected to 16-bit signed
- Battery bitmap check corrected (`b1 & 0x20`)
- Chart X axis uses real timestamps in seconds
- Stream sync drain prevents frame alignment errors
- R8 minification enabled; debug/release app IDs separated

## v1.0.0

- Initial release: BT Classic connection to Shimmer3 GSR+ and ExG units
- Live signal display and MPAndroidChart graph
- Basic CSV recording
- Settings screen with BT radio ID configuration


### Added
- Diagnostic Log screen with colour-coded entries (DEBUG / INFO / OK / WARN / ERROR)
- Error count badge on Log tab icon
- Per-signal configurable sampling rates (hardware rate + software decimation)
- Independent recording signal selection (separate from Live view display selection)
- One CSV file per signal per recording session, with ISO 8601 timestamps
- Session-grouped recordings view with per-file share and delete
- Recording setup sheet showing output rate per signal before starting
- Supported-parameter enforcement — unavailable signals greyed out in selectors

### Fixed
- Channel-list-based packet parser (replaces bitmap inference)  
  — all sensor channels now display correctly, not just PPG
- Inquiry response bitmap offset corrected (byte 4, not byte 3)
- ADXL345 accel data width corrected to 16-bit signed (from 14-bit masked)
- Battery bitmap check corrected (b1 & 0x20, not b1 shr 13)
- Chart X axis now uses real timestamps in seconds (was sample index)
- Stream sync drain after rate command prevents frame alignment errors

### Changed
- Increased text contrast throughout (EnactOnSurfaceDim for secondary labels)
- R8 minification enabled for release builds
- Debug APK uses `.debug` application ID suffix — can coexist with release

## v1.0.0

- Initial release: BT Classic connection to Shimmer3 GSR+ and ExG units
- Live signal display and MPAndroidChart graph
- Basic CSV recording
- Settings screen with BT radio ID configuration
